# odin-recipes

This is my first ever project using The Odin Project.

By the end of this I will be able to:

1. Create a HTML website
2. Link other pages to a main page
3. Add images to the site
4. Create Git commits
5. Use the git add and git commit commands
6. Add meaningful git comments
7. Use git push origin main to upload the files to my Github account

Project end thoughts:

1. It wasn't as hard getting into the swing of commiting to Git consistently as I thought.
2. I did mess up some commits by not doing them early enough, however, I think I managed quite well.
3. Building a simple project as a warmup is very nice.

Update 16.04.2023

1. Adding basic CSS to the pages
2. Figuring out the necessary attributes is a bit clapped lol
