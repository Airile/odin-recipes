      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        A stack of warm, fluffy pancakes are sure to bring smiles to even the
        groggiest early morning risers. You can also prepare pancakes in advance
        and store in the freezer to be reheated in the microwave for a quick
        breakfast when you’re in a hurry.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
