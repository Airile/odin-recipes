      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Kimchi, is a traditional Korean side dish of salted and fermented
        vegetables, such as napa cabbage and Korean radish. A wide selection of
        seasonings are used, including gochugaru, spring onions, garlic, ginger,
        and jeotgal, etc. Kimchi is also used in a variety of soups and stews.

      <p>
        This kimchi recipe has the traditional flavor I am looking for. It uses
        the whole cabbage leaf, which makes it more labor-intensive than the
        other ones on my website, because you’ll need to take time to spread the
        spicy paste leaf by leaf. It’s more work, but this is the traditional
        style and if you can make this kind of kimchi well, you can consider
        yourself good at Korean cooking.
      </p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2.7kg napa cabbage</li>
        <li>72 grams of Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sweet rice flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups korean radish matchsticks</li>
        <li>1 cup carrot matchsticks</li>
        <li>7 to 8 green onions</li>
        <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>24 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 tsp ginger, minced</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, minced</li>
        <li>0.5 cup fish sauce</li>
        <li>0.5 cup oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups gochugaru</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Cut a slit through the core of each half, 2 inches above the stem. You
          want the cabbage leaves to be loose but still attached to the core.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dunk the halves in a large basin of water to get them wet. Sprinkle
          salt between the leaves by lifting up every leaf and getting salt in
          there. Use more salt closer to the stems, where the leaves are
          thicker.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let the cabbages rest for 2 hours. Turn over every 30 minutes, so they
          get well salted. From time to time you can ladle some of the salty
          water from the bottom of the basin over top of the cabbages if you
          want to.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 2 hours, wash the cabbage halves a few times under cold running
          water. Giving them a good washing, to remove the salt and any dirt. As
          you wash, split the halves into quarters along the slits you cut into
          earlier. Cut off the cores, give them a final rinse, and put them in a
          strainer over a basin so they can drain well.
        </li>
        <p>
          While the cabbage is salting for 2 hours, and in between the times
          you’re turning it over, you can make the porridge:
        </p>
        <li>
          Combine the water and the sweet rice flour in a small pot. Mix well
          with a wooden spoon and let it cook over medium heat for about 10
          minutes until it starts to bubble. Add the sugar and cook 1 more
          minute, stirring. Remove from the heat and let it cool off completely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour cooled porridge into a large mixing bowl. Add garlic, ginger,
          onion, fish sauce, fermented salted shrimp, and hot pepper flakes. Mix
          well with the wooden spoon until the mixture turns into a thin paste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the radish, carrot, and green onion, plus the Asian chives (or
          more green onions) and the water dropwort if you’re using them. Mix
          well.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, spread some kimchi paste on each cabbage leaf. When
          every leaf in a quarter is covered with paste, wrap it around itself
          into a small packet, and put into your jar, plastic container, or
          onggi.
        </li>
        <li>Eat right away, or let it sit for a few days to ferment.</li>
        <li>
          The kimchi will start fermenting a day or two at room temperature,
          depending on the temperature and humidity of your room. The warmer and
          more humid it is, the faster the kimchi will ferment. Once it starts
          to ferment it will smell and taste sour, and pressing on the top of
          the kimchi with a spoon will release bubbles from beneath. If you’re
          using a sealed jar with a lid, be sure to open it once a while, let it
          breathe, and press down on the top of the kimchi.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once it starts to fermented, store in the refrigerator to use as
          needed. This slows down the fermentation process, which will make the
          kimchi more and more sour as time goes on.
        </li>
